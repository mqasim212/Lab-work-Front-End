        <p>There are some early hints that certain coronavirus vaccines might be able to reduce transmission, even if they can’t eliminate it entirely.
          One way they might do this is by reducing the number of viral particles in people’s bodies, says Keith Neal, professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham.
          "It is quite likely that if the vaccines are making people less ill, they are producing less virus, and therefore will be less infectious, but that's just a theory," he says.

        <p>The available Covid-19 vaccines have primarily been judged on their ability to prevent symptoms from developing. Their ability to prevent transmission is now being evaluated as a secondary endpoint for many of them.
          Scientists are looking to see whether they are having an impact on infection rates in places where they have already been widely distributed
